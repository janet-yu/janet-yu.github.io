    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>I am currently undeclared, but I hope to pursue a major in Computer Science. I am currently self-studying HTML/CSS/JavaScript, as well as Python. I hope to become more proficient in making websites! </p>
    <p>Some other hobbies of mine are drawing/design, I particularly like working on vector art using inkscape, cooking is also great fun, as well as learning languages.</p>
